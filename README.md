Hello There!

I'm Amelia and I am just getting started with GitHub. I am hoping to be a software developer in the near future. I did 4 years of web design back in high school (which was about 10 years ago now) and recently freshened up my knowledge of HTML and CSS and learned bootstrap. I am now working on SQL and next will be Python and JavaScript!
